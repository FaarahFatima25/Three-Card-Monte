Three-Card Monte is a classic street scam that preys on gullible tourists and other easy targets. The game involves three playing cards, one of which is the 'red lady'—the Queen of Hearts—placed facedown on a cardboard box. The dealer swiftly shuffles the cards and challenges the player to find the Queen of Hearts.

But here’s the catch: the dealer uses clever tricks and sleight-of-hand to hide the card or otherwise cheat, making sure the player never wins. Often, accomplices in the crowd, known as shills, work secretly with the dealer. Some pretend to win big to lure in victims, while others deliberately lose badly, giving false confidence to the next player.

This program recreates the excitement and trickery of the game. It displays the three cards, describes a quick series of swaps, and then clears the screen. Your challenge? Pick the Queen of Hearts—if you can!
